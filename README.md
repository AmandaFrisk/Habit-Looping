# Habit-Looping


The Habit Looping application was created as a unit 2 project for a software engineering immersive bootcamp. It is a full-stack application using Node.js, Mongoose, Express, EJS and Bootstrap. The application adhers to a MVC file structure. The model uses the 7 RESTful routes and full CRUD. I used https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database cloud service to manage the data used in this application.

The current application allows users to register and gain access to a shared database with a list of habits. Users can view, edit, add and delete habits from the list. 

The application is deployed through Heroku and can be accessed here: https://habit-looping-app.herokuapp.com/

Forthcoming Features:

Individual database rather than shared. |
Habit daily tracking system and visual goal tracker that utilized tracking data. |
Additional ejs files containing information about the concept of habit looping as well as resources available for further research. |
Habit cue feature- users can identify their habit cues and set reminders. |
Habit reward feature- users can identify their daily reward assigned to the habit. (ex: drinking the recommended daily amount of water = 30 | minutes watching TikToks). As well as rewards attached to reaching tracking goals. ( ex: tracking every day for a week = treating yourself to your favorite specialty coffee drink ) |
Fully mobile friendly.

Technologies Used:
Node.js |
Mongoose |

Approach:

Create an application that is : user friendly, aesthetically pleasing and set up in a way that additional features can be added.


Unsolved Problems:
The sign out feature appears to work sometimes but not others. Thus far it appears to sometimes not work after user makes an edit then tries to sign out directly after.
